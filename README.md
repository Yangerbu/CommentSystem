##### This is the part of frontend of comment system, which is developed with angularjs and bootstrap. All data show in the page are hard-code. You can clone these code and realize backend with other backend language such as java. This system is a two-level comment system. I have realized a java version in master branch, and you can watch it then give me some advice.
